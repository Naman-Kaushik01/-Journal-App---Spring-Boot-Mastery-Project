#  Journal App â€“ Spring Boot Mastery Project
A demo application to consolidate and apply learning from the Spring Boot Mastery:  With this project, I'm building a personal Journal App, showcasing my understanding of Spring Bootâ€”from RESTful design and database integration to advanced features like validation, configuration, security, and deployment readiness.

# Journal App â€“ Spring Boot Mastery

This project serves as my personal Journal App, developed while following the **Spring Boot Mastery: From Basics to Advanced** tutorial series. It captures my progress learning various Spring Boot techniquesâ€”a great reference for self-review and for anyone starting out with Spring Boot!
